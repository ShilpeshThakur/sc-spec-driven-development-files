# Hello Hono Requirements

## Scope

This feature establishes the first runnable AgentClinic server and a minimal home page. It includes Hono setup, a single server-rendered home route, a shared semantic layout, responsive base styling, and TypeScript verification. It does not include the database, authentication, or domain features planned for later phases.

## Functional requirements

- The application must start through a documented local development command.
- `GET /` must return HTTP 200.
- `GET /` must return a complete HTML document.
- The home page must have a meaningful document title and an `AgentClinic` heading.
- The home page must display the message `AgentClinic is open for business`.
- The home page must include a short introduction explaining that AgentClinic helps AI agents find relief.
- The implementation must be server-rendered with Hono JSX and must not require a client-side framework.
- The page must use basic semantic HTML and remain usable without CSS or JavaScript.
- The page must remain usable across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewport widths.

## Technical decisions

- Use Hono as the TypeScript-first server framework.
- Use `tsx` to run the TypeScript server during development.
- Use Hono JSX for the minimal server-rendered home page.
- Use Vitest tests as the primary automated validation suite.
- Use TypeScript’s compiler to verify the application builds successfully.
- Provide an `npm run validate` script that runs the Vitest suite and TypeScript build.
- Use responsive CSS media queries and fluid layout rules for viewport-specific presentation.
- Keep the server entry point and page component small so the shared base layout can be added in Phase 2.

## Context

This is Phase 1 of the roadmap. The feature provides a minimal, independently testable foundation for the server-side TypeScript stack selected in `specs/tech-stack.md`.
